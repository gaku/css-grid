css-grid
========

A responsive 12-column grid CSS. I wanted a responsive grid system and found One% CSS Grid. Then, I wanted to use grid system in nested DIVs, and found @davist11's Nested Responsive Grid.  Mine doesn't do anything beyond his version, but I just wanted to learn Sass and implemented very similar one.

# Build

It's a straight .scss file.  `sass grid.scss grid.css` generates the file.  You can use Rake too.
